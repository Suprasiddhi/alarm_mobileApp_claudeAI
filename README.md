# ⏰ Alarm App (React Native + TypeScript)

A simple mobile alarm application built using **React Native with TypeScript** as a learning project to understand the basics of mobile app development.

This project was created as a **trial/practice app** and focuses on learning how modern mobile applications can be developed with the help of **AI-assisted coding tools**.


## Project Description

This is a basic alarm mobile application developed using React Native.
The goal of this project is not to build a production-ready application, but to:

* learn the fundamentals of mobile app development,
* understand React Native with TypeScript,
* experiment with Expo for quick UI preview,
* and explore how AI tools can be used as coding assistants during development.

The UI and functionality were tested using **Expo Go** as a temporary preview environment.


## Technologies Used

* **React Native**
* **TypeScript**
* **Expo**
* **Expo Go** (for live preview and testing)
* **Visual Studio** (IDE)


## Use of AI Assistance

The initial reference code and structure for this project were generated with the help of **Claude (AI assistant)**.

The generated code was used as a learning reference and starting point.
I modified and studied the code to better understand how different components and logic work in a React Native application.

This project reflects my learning approach in the current era of AI-assisted development.


## Purpose of the Project

This project was created to:

* learn the basics of mobile app development,
* understand React Native project structure,
* practice TypeScript in a real application,
* explore how AI can support and speed up the learning process.


## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the Expo development server

```bash
npx expo start
```

3. Open the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device and scan the QR code to preview the application.


## Features (Basic)

* Simple alarm interface
* Basic alarm setup and UI
* Mobile preview using Expo Go

*(Feature set is intentionally minimal, as this is a learning project.)*


## Disclaimer

This project uses AI-generated code as a learning reference.
The goal is educational and exploratory, not commercial use.
